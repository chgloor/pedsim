# pedsim
PEDSIM is a microscopic pedestrian crowd simulation system. It is suitable for use in crowd simulations (e.g. indoor evacuation simulation, large scale outdoor simulations), where quantitative measurements like pedestrian density or evacuation time matter. The quality of the individual agent's trajectory is high enough for creating massive pedestrian crowd animations (e.g. for motion pictures or architectural visualization). Since PEDSIM is easy to use and extend, it is a good starting point for science projects.
